# Are You On The Right Path?

This version of the rootkit works by appending the PATH variable in .bashrc  
It will create clones of basic commands that the user is likely to use such as `ls` or `cat` or `cd` etc.  
It would hide the directory in which the magic happens :)

## Requirements

It should work on any standard linux system (no guarantees though)
